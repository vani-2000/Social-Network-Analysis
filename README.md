# Social-Network-Analysis
We analyzed two social networks, the Twitter network, and Epinions social network, where we find all the centrality measures, and analyze the difference between them, also find the clustering coefficient. We also applied the community detection algorithm Girvan Newman algorithm and Ravasz algorithm on the networks We created a random network and analyze how the giant component appears at different value of average degree k. We created a scale-free network using Barbasi Albert Model and applied Independent Cascade Model (ICM) to find the minimum number steps required to get to the maximum number of nodes.
